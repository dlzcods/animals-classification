# Animals Classification
This project explores the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of animal image classification. I have curated a dataset of diverse animal images and employed transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained models on our specific task. The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy and contribute to the field of computer vision.

## To Do
- Using a dataset with a total amount of 10000+ data
- Training and test accuracy of at least 95%
- The model was able to classify at least 3 different classes

## Dataset
To support the define objectives, the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piyushkumar18/animal-image-classification-dataset) was obtained from kaggle with 12 different classes and 17000+ data. However, due to limited resources, only 10 classes will be used in this project.
